## Notes on time and space complexity 

- logarithm is the inverse of exponents: O(log n) is fast
- base for a logarithm is 2. If the input size is n, the algo will perform p operations, where 2<sup>p</sup> = n. For all practical purposes this simply means that a percentag of the input is necessarily eliminated with each pass.
- O(n * log n) is considered efficient for sorting algos
